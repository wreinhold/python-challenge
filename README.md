# python-challenge

This was an assignment for my Data Science Bootcamp through UNC Chapel Hill. We were tasked to write code to perform various analysis on two data sets, one for banks and the other for polls.

This Python Challenge involves loops, lists, dictionaries, and other basic Python functions.
I also read in files, used OS & CSV libraries, and ultimately wrote to text files. 

For information on writing to text files, I used https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-write-text-file/, as this information was not covered in class.
